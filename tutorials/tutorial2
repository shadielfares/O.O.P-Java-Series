Constructors is basically what does the instantiation of a class.

If you do not have a constructor initalized within the class, then you cannot instantiate

eg.

class Person{
	attributes...
		public Person(){

		}	
}

It is used to associate attributes with a class, but also can be used like this:

Person p = new {Person}();

If you expect a name in this code structure for example:

class Person{
	attributes..
	public Person(String name){

	}
}

Then calling instantiating with a constructor:

	Person p = new Person (?) -  this will return an error, since expecting a variable name.

Can choose to set a different constructor as well that removes the p.setname = ""
eg:

class Person{
	attributes..
	public Person(String name){

	}
	// This will allow a developer to instantiate it with or without a name
	public Person(){

	}
}
